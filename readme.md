# Collagen Prototype
Visulisation created to simulate bulk water diffusion inside a generalised collagen network (radial zone). The aim
is to extend my university research project ([Bulk Water Diffusion](https://github.com/justinac0/BulkWaterDiffusion))
to be simulating the diffusion of water inside this network.
